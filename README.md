# Sample Hardhat Project for Polygon Bootcamp Class 2022

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

This was deployed on the Polgon Mumbai Testnet @ https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xbd34900c6db48b44854df3971a9b8ef851ce5a92

Try running some of the following tasks:

npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
